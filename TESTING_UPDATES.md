# Testing Updates - October 25, 2025

## 🎉 What's New

We've significantly enhanced the Chattrix test suite with **75 comprehensive automated tests** covering critical functionality.

## 📊 Test Coverage

### ✅ Excellent Coverage (80%+)

- **Authentication Controller** - 17 tests, 81% coverage
- **Shop Controller** - 26 tests, 82% coverage
- **Warehouse Controller** - 23 tests, 81% coverage

### 🔧 Basic Coverage

- **Message Controller** - 6 tests, 13% coverage (needs expansion)

### 🔴 No Coverage Yet

- User Controller - 0% (planned)
- Middleware - 0% (planned)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run Tests with Coverage

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Use Test Runner Script

```bash
# Show test status
./run-tests.sh status

# Run all tests
./run-tests.sh

# Run with coverage
./run-tests.sh coverage

# Run in watch mode
./run-tests.sh watch

# See all options
./run-tests.sh help
```

## ✨ Key Features Tested

### Authentication & Authorization ✅

- User login/logout
- Password hashing & verification
- JWT token generation
- Role-based permissions (employee, admin, super_admin, manager, warehouseman)
- Shop and user activity validation
- User creation with proper authorization

### Shop Management ✅

- Shop creation with auto-generated admin/warehouse users
- CRUD operations with role-based access control
- Shop statistics and user counting
- Shop uniqueness validation
- Shop deletion safeguards

### Warehouse Management ✅

- Warehouse listing and assignment
- Cross-shop communication permissions
- Dynamic warehouse reassignment
- Multi-warehouse support
- Access control validation

### External Requests ✅

- External request tracking
- Status management (pending, sending, keeping, rejected)
- Direction marking (outgoing/incoming)
- Manager-only access control

## 🎯 Test Quality

### What Makes These Tests Good

- ✅ **Isolated** - Each test runs independently
- ✅ **Fast** - Using MongoDB Memory Server (in-memory database)
- ✅ **Comprehensive** - Cover success and failure scenarios
- ✅ **Clear** - Descriptive test names and assertions
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Well-organized with proper setup/teardown

### Best Practices Followed

- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock objects for request/response
- Database cleanup after each test
- Environment variables properly configured
- Edge case validation
- Permission boundary testing

## 🔧 Configuration

### Jest Setup

- **Framework:** Jest with ES Module support
- **Database:** MongoDB Memory Server
- **Environment:** Node.js test environment
- **Coverage:** Automated coverage reporting

### Environment Variables (Test)

```bash
JWT_SECRET=test-jwt-secret-key-for-testing
NODE_ENV=test
```

## 📈 Next Steps

### High Priority

1. Expand message controller tests (target: 30-40 tests)
2. Create user controller tests (target: 15-20 tests)
3. Add middleware tests (target: 8-10 tests)

### Medium Priority

4. Integration tests for complete workflows
5. Password and notification controller tests
6. Frontend test expansion

### Long Term

7. E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
8. Performance testing
9. CI/CD pipeline integration

## 🎓 For Developers

### Writing New Tests

```javascript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, jest } from "@jest/globals";

describe("Your Controller Tests", () => {
  let testData, res;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Setup test data
    res = {
      status: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
      json: jest.fn(),
    };
  });

  it("should do something expected", async () => {
    const req = {
      /* ... */
    };
    await yourFunction(req, res);
    expect(res.status).toHaveBeenCalledWith(200);
  });
});
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test authController.test.js

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Verbose output
npm test -- --verbose
```

## 📊 Coverage Goals

| Metric     | Current | Target |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ |
| Statements | 23%     | 80%+   |
| Branches   | 20%     | 75%+   |
| Functions  | 24%     | 80%+   |
| Lines      | 23%     | 80%+   |

## 🏆 Success Metrics

### Achieved ✅

- ✅ 75 tests passing
- ✅ 5 test suites created
- ✅ 80%+ coverage for auth, shop, warehouse
- ✅ Jest configured with ESM support
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### In Progress 🔧

- 🔧 Message controller expansion
- 🔧 User controller tests
- 🔧 Middleware tests
- 🔧 Integration tests

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests not running?

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Check Jest is installed
npm list jest
```

### ESM module errors?

- Ensure `"type": "module"` in package.json
- Check NODE_OPTIONS flag in test scripts

### MongoDB errors?

- MongoDB Memory Server handles this automatically
- Check setup.js configuration
