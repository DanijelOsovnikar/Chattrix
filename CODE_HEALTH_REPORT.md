## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### ✅ Strong Areas

#### 1. Authentication System

**Coverage: 81%** | **17 Tests**

The authentication system is well-tested with comprehensive coverage of:

- User login with multiple validation scenarios
- Password hashing and verification
- JWT token generation and cookie management
- User registration and creation
- Role-based permission assignment
- Shop and user activity validation
- Cross-shop access restrictions

**Strengths:**

- Handles edge cases (inactive users, inactive shops)
- Tests all user roles (employee, admin, super_admin)
- Validates password security
- Tests authorization failures

**Recommendations:**

- Add tests for session expiration
- Test concurrent login scenarios
- Add tests for token refresh logic

---

#### 2. Shop Management

**Coverage: 82%** | **26 Tests**

Shop management functionality is thoroughly tested:

- Shop creation with auto-generated admin/warehouse users
- CRUD operations with proper authorization
- Shop statistics and analytics
- User count tracking
- Code uniqueness and formatting

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive CRUD testing
- Role-based access control validation
- Automatic user creation on shop setup
- Shop deletion safeguards

**Recommendations:**

- Test bulk shop operations
- Add tests for shop archiving/reactivation
- Test shop settings modifications

---

#### 3. Warehouse Management

**Coverage: 81%** | **23 Tests**

Warehouse assignment and cross-shop communication:

- Warehouse listing and filtering
- Dynamic warehouse assignment
- Cross-shop communication permissions
- Multi-warehouse support

**Strengths:**

- Tests super admin privileges
- Validates warehouse assignments
- Tests dynamic reassignment
- Covers permission checks

**Recommendations:**

- Add tests for warehouse communication limits
- Test warehouse capacity management
- Add tests for warehouse user roles

---

### 🔴 Areas Needing Attention

#### 1. Message Controller

**Coverage: 13%** | **6 Tests** | **Priority: HIGH**

The message controller is the core of the application but has minimal test coverage.

**Current Tests:**

- Basic external request tracking
- Status updates for external requests
- Manager access control

**Missing Tests:**

- Regular message sending (employee → warehouse)
- Group message distribution
- Message status updates (checked/unchecked)
- Real-time notifications
- Push notifications
- Socket.io integration
- Warehouse message forwarding
- Cross-shop message routing

**Impact:** High - This is core business functionality
**Recommendation:** Prioritize creating 30-40 additional tests

---

#### 2. User Controller

**Coverage: 0%** | **0 Tests** | **Priority: HIGH**

No tests exist for user management operations.

**Missing Tests:**

- Get all users with filtering
- Get users for sidebar
- Update user profiles
- Deactivate/reactivate users
- Role updates
- Permission modifications
- Group member management

**Impact:** High - Critical for user management
**Recommendation:** Create 15-20 tests covering CRUD operations

---

#### 3. Middleware

**Coverage: 0%** | **0 Tests** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

Authentication and authorization middleware lacks tests.

**Missing Tests:**

- `protectRoute` - JWT validation
- `shopAuth` - Shop-based authorization
- Token expiration handling
- Invalid token scenarios
- Cookie parsing

**Impact:** Medium - Security-critical but straightforward
**Recommendation:** Create 8-10 middleware tests

---

#### 4. Additional Controllers

**Coverage: 0%** | **Priority: LOW-MEDIUM**

- **Password Controller:** Password reset functionality (0% coverage)
- **Notification Settings:** User preferences (0% coverage)
- **Subscribe Controller:** Push notifications (0% coverage)

**Recommendation:** Add basic tests for each (5-10 tests per controller)

---
