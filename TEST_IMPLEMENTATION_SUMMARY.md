## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Testing Infrastructure

- **Framework:** Jest with ES Modules support
- **Database:** MongoDB Memory Server (isolated test database)
- **Configuration:**
  - `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules` flag
  - JWT_SECRET environment variable
  - NODE_ENV=test

### Test Structure

```javascript
describe("Controller/Feature", () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Create test data
  });

  describe("Specific Function", () => {
    it("should handle success case", async () => {
      // Arrange, Act, Assert
    });

    it("should handle error case", async () => {
      // Test error scenarios
    });
  });
});
```

### Mock Patterns

```javascript
const res = {
  status: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
  json: jest.fn(),
  cookie: jest.fn(),
};

const req = {
  user: mockUser,
  params: { id: "..." },
  body: { ... },
  cookies: { jwt: "..." },
};
```

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### 1. Jest ESM Configuration

**Problem:** Jest couldn't parse ES modules  
**Solution:** Added `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules` to npm scripts and configured `jest.config.js` with proper module name mapping

### 2. JWT_SECRET Undefined

**Problem:** JWT verification failing in tests  
**Solution:** Added `JWT_SECRET` to `Backend/tests/setup.js` environment variables

### 3. User Controller Test Failures

**Problem:** 3 initial test failures in user controller  
**Solution:**

- Fixed password property check expectations
- Corrected user selection for 404 tests
- Updated super_admin self-reassignment test logic

### 4. Middleware Mongoose Document Issues

**Problem:** `.toObject()` not preserving `shopId` property  
**Solution:** Used Mongoose documents directly instead of converting to plain objects
